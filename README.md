# Tropical Cyclone Tracker

## (Walmart Summer Engineering Project ðŸ¤“)


### A few quick housekeeping notes:
- Unlike the title suggests, includes both tropical & subtropical cyclones
- Unlike the title suggests again, does not include Pacific hurricanes & typhoons
- New features may be updated on a rolling basis
- All data are owned by and attributed to NOAA's National Hurricane Center (https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/)

### What does it do? (coming soon)
